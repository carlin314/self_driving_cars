# Self Driving Cars Projects

Projects for Self Driving Cars:

1. [Lane Lines Detection](lane_lines_detection/): Using computer vision to detect the location of lane lines in a video.
2. [Advanced Lane Detection](advanced_lane_lines_detection/): Using advanced concepts from computer vision to detect the location of lane lines and distance from center in a more percise fashion in a video.
3. [Traffic Sign Classification with Deep Learning](traffic_sign_classifier/): Using Convolutional Neural Network to classify traffic signs in images.
4. [Driving behavior Cloning with Deep Learning](behavior_cloning_deep_learning/): Using Convolutional Neural Network to clone driving behavior in a simulator and drive autonomously in a simulator.
5. [Vehicle Tracking using SVM](vehicle_tracking/): Tracking the locations of a vehicle in a video using Support Vector Machines.
6. [Object detection using YOLO](object_detection_YOLO/): Object detection using You Only Look Once (YOLO).
7. [Object detection using faster RCNN](object_detection_faster_RCNN/): Object detection using faster RCNN.
